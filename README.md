## 🧰 Requirements

Make sure you have the following Python packages installed:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4

📂 Output
✅ Scraped data is saved to kompas_headlines.csv

✅ You can extend the scripts for real-world sources (e.g. Kompas, KAI, BMKG)

📌 Notes
All scripts are educational and safe for learning use.

Rate limiting and headers are implemented to simulate ethical scraping.

No live site is scraped by default – data is simulated.
